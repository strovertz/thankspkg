## 🙏 The Idea

Everyone’s out here thanking LLMs like GPT, DeepSeek, AutoMagicCodeGen9000™...

We decided to join in.  
But when you run this package, something beautiful happens.

Instead of praising machine learning, it does the right thing:

### It thanks the **terminal**.

Because let’s be honest:

- Who's been there for you at 2am during a broken deployment?
- Who helped you `cd` out of that `/lost+found` hole?
- Who runs your tests, your builds, your chaos?

> Not GPT. Not DeepSeek.  
> **Bash.**

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
dpkg -i thanks_0.1-1_all.deb
thanks


-- FUCK GPTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT .i.
